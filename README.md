# Exercise for adding features to a legacy system

## The legacy system
- it's a CLI for making and displaying doctor appointments

## Features currently supported:
- display existing appointments in a tabular format (to a terminal)
  - appointments older than 6 months show as EXPIRED
- create new appointments (from terminal)

## Features todo:
- ability to change display format to list (and back to tabular if user wants it)
  - this should be achievable by user choice at the CLI (*l* for list and *t* for tabular)
- ability to add (to new appointments) and display appointment comments
